Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative to parallel-port-based motion control for CNC milling. This version of Grbl runs is use on the Cyclone PCB Factory with a Arudino Nano using the CNC Shield v4. 

The controller is written in highly optimized C utilizing every clever feature of the AVR-chips to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain up to 30kHz of stable, jitter free control pulses.

It accepts standards-compliant g-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported, as well as, all other primary g-code commands. Macro functions, variables, and most canned cycles are not supported, but we think GUIs can do a much better job at translating them into straight g-code anyhow.

Grbl includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 16 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.

* [Licensing](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Licensing): Grbl is free software, released under the GPLv3 license.

* Built on the wonderful Grbl v0.6 (2011) firmware written by Simen Svale Skogsrud (Norway).
